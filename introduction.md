In the fewest words, Anthropic reasoning involves:

1. Noticing an ever-present [selection effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias)
2. Reasoning according to simple statistical principle

---

1. Observation selection effects arise from the precondition that an observer must exist to collect and analyze data.

Consider life on Earth: one might conclude that intelligent life emerging here suggests it's common on planets such as ours. But we necessarily find ourselves on a planet where intelligence evolved, regardless of its cosmic rarity. So the observation selection effect tells us we are exceptional, but not *how* exceptional, and certainly no more than necessary. Even if we could telepathically conduct a blind census of every alien civilization to evolve, they would all report evolving on life-bearing worldsâ€”telling us nothing about how often this kind of thing happens naturally.
 

Another selection effect might be more elucidating:
If a lock, which typically takes $t=$ 100 hours to pick, must be picked within 1 hour, the only successful attempts will be those rare, lucky ones. The probability of success within time $T$ decays exponentially with $t/T$. But among *successful* attempts, the distribution of completion times becomes nearly identical for all very difficult locks ($t \gg T$). In fact, when examining successful attempts, we cannot distinguish between locks of different difficulties once they're sufficiently harder than our cutoff of 1 hour. A lock that takes 1 hour on average might pass for one that took 100; 100 will look identical to one that's often 1 million hours (again, if we only observe attempts that succeeded within an hour).


We may be able to use our [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) to say something about how "hard" it was for intelligent life to evolve on Earth. If the lock, so to speak, must be picked by the dusk of our main sequence star (10Byrs) and evolution is very hard ( $\gg$ 10Byrs), then we should expect to see it in its death throes. Instead, we find ourselves with 5.4Byrs to spare.
