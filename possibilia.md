## Possible worlds

Entertain, for a moment, an addition to SSA:
> Given the fact that you exist, you should (other things equal)
favor hypotheses according to which many observers exist over
hypotheses on which few observers exist.

(SIA)

SIA demands that, ceteris paribus, hypotheses predicting $2N$ observers should receive twice the credence of those predicting $N$ observers. This leads to absurd conclusions in simple thought experimentsâ€”e.g., being virtually certain ($P$=99.9999%) of an outcome that creates a million observers over one that creates one, *even if* our prior heavily favored the latter. This is deeply counterintuitive and flies in the face of the scientific method.

Under SIA, we must then be certain ($P$=1) that we belong to an infinite world with infinite observers! Surely, this cannot be known a priori.

SIA is wrong because it treats possible worlds as if they were real (i.e. we're more likely to be observing from the most populated possible world). Our existence only disconfirms hypotheses making observers unlikely; it need not privilege hypotheses simply for predicting more of them. 

As an anti-realist, I've no interest in carrying water for the opposing camp. Possibilia are not real. Any "serious" work on the subject is concerned with intelligibility or playing word games.
That being said, our anthropic solutions to problems like DA and the Fermi paradox make certain claims about observers in the future. Does this commit us to some kind of [Eternalism](https://iep.utm.edu/eternalism/)?

i.e. "I could've been an observer elsewhere" (spatial) vs "I could've been one else*when*" (temporal)... are these equivalent claims?
