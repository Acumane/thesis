In applications of anthropic reasoning (and the scientific method), our limited sample size requires us to distinguish between improbability and genuine surprise. 

### How lucky is too lucky?
While any specific universe configuration is improbable (analogous to any specific sequence of 100 coin flips having $P=2^{-100}$), some configurations strike us as demanding explanation.


Consider three scenarios:
1. Winning a lottery with $10^9$ tickets
2. Winning three consecutive lotteries with $10^3$ tickets each
3. A monkey typing "Give me a banana!" vs. "r78o479024io; jl;"

Though (1) and (2) are equally improbable, only (2) raises suspicion of rigging. Similarly, while both monkey-typed sequences are vastly improbable, only the meaningful one suggests non-random causation.

A concern articulated by Gould is that we might look at any universe and marvel, "had things been different, we wouldn't have *this*." Van Inwagen dismisses this as "annoyingly obtuse," offering a straw-drawing analogy: if survival requires drawing the shortest of $2^{20}$ straws, survival strongly suggests riggingâ€”despite each straw being equally probable. Clearly, a condition can exist that distinguishes one outcome from a great many other ones.

Horwich provides some useful criteria: an event $E$ is surprising if...
- The circumstances $C$ that made $E$ seem improbable are themselves made less probable by $E$'s occurrence
- There exists some alternative explanation $K$ that, while initially unlikely, would make $E$ highly probable

On [fine-tuning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/): while *any* set of physical constants is improbable, life-permitting ones reduce our confidence in pure chance ($C$) while lending credence to either design or multiverse hypotheses ($K$).
