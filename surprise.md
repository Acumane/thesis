In applications of anthropic reasoning (and the scientific method), our limited sample size requires us to distinguish between improbability and genuine surprise. 

### How lucky is too lucky?
Gould dismisses the question as meaningless; we might look at any universe and marvel, "had things been different, we wouldn't have *this*." Van Inwagen dismisses this as "annoyingly obtuse," offering a straw-drawing analogy: if survival requires drawing the shortest of $2^{20}$ straws, survival strongly suggests rigging—despite each straw being equally probable. Clearly, a condition can exist that distinguishes one outcome from a great many other ones. Say only 100 universes are possible. While each configuration is equally improbable (1/100), some are categorically unique—say, habitable ones versus not. If the former is much less common, the two sets do not have equal odds.

Consider these scenarios:
1. Winning a lottery with $10^9$ tickets versus winning three consecutive lotteries with $10^3$ tickets each
3. A monkey typing "Give me a banana" versus "r78o4790 24io ja"

Though (1) and (2) are equally improbable, only (2) raises suspicion of rigging. But does it? If consecutive wins are more surprising, let's flip some coins. For consecutive heads odds $(\frac{1}{2})^n$ to equal $\frac{1}{10^9}$, $n = \log_2(10^9) \approx 29.897$
Are you any more surprised by 30 consecutive heads than by these lotteries? If you feel like these three outcomes are anything but equally unlikely, we shouldn't rely on intuitions of surprise.

<!-- Similarly, while both monkey-typed sequences are vastly improbable, only the meaningful one suggests non-random causation. -->

Horwich provides some useful criteria: an event $E$ is surprising if...
- The circumstances $C$ that made $E$ seem improbable are themselves made less probable by $E$'s occurrence
- There exists some alternative explanation $K$ that, while initially unlikely, would make $E$ highly probable

On [fine-tuning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/): while *any* set of physical constants is improbable, life-permitting ones reduce our confidence in pure chance ($C$) while lending credence to either design or multiverse hypotheses ($K$).
