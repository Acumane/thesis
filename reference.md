## Problems of the reference class

Defining the reference class is a difficult task. It mustn't be too wide as to include inanimate objects, but where do we draw the line?

If our reference class is chosen according to our hypothesis, then maybe the ambiguity exists only in our language. If our goal, for some reason, concerns "red" balls, we might classify them as "faint-pink-to-wine," or further qualify with "-that most people without Protanomaly would agree on."

This flexibility proves problematic. If we can narrow reference classes arbitrarily (e.g., to "humans born on my birthdate or later"), we'll absurdly predict our imminent demise. Leslie attempts to rescue this by arguing that sufficiently low priors would neutralize such outcomes. This solution fails: different yet equally valid reference classes (e.g. "all humans" vs. "everyone that knows who first discovered DNA's structure") yield different posterior probabilities for the same hypothesis. We've no reason to believe that the latter class should meet their doom any sooner than the rest of humanity, and yet SSA will say it does.
