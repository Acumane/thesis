## Problem of infinite cosmos

The Duhem-Quine challenge to science goes like this: when evidence seems to contradict a theory, we can always preserve it by bringing auxiliary assumptions into question. If a telescope finds a planet where Newton says it shouldn't be, we could doubt Newton—or doubt our telescope, or posit some unknown mass affecting it. Given modern cosmology is at least agnostic to an infinite cosmos, we might not get away with abducting anything, let alone the observer selection effect.

In an infinite cosmos, the most unlikely events you could imagine occur infinitely often. This includes "freak observers": conscious brains emerging through statistically anomalous fluctuations. Infinitely many of them will have illusory memories and experiences or will be making veridical observations of illusory spacetime. Consider two cosmological models differing only in their prediction of, say, cosmic microwave background temperature. Naively, measuring 2.7K should favor the theory predicting 2.7K. Yet both theories, if they admit an infinite universe, predict the existence of infinitely many observers measuring every possible temperature.

While intuition suggests normal observers (arising through standard evolutionary processes) should vastly outnumber their spontaneously-materialized counterparts, cardinality says otherwise. For reference, despite evens being twice as "rare" as naturals, Cantor demonstrates their equipotence through the bijection $f(n) = 2n$. The same can be done between observer classes. To generalize, suppose normal observers are n times more probable than freak observers within some finite volume. In an infinite space, both populations become countably infinite. The mapping $f$: Freak $\mapsto$ Normal that sends the $k$th freak observer to the $nk$th normal observer is bijective—proving their equinumerosity despite the apparent "rarity" of freaks.

So we cannot exclude ourselves from being freak observers. Fortunately, this is just as much a problem for the rest of science. What to do?
